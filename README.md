# Dynamic Lighting for Unity.

This package brings an old school lighting technique to Unity.

It is inspired by Tim Sweeney's lighting system in Unreal Gold and Unreal Tournament (1996-1999).

This lighting technique precomputes unique shadows for each light source, allowing dynamic adjustments such as color changes, flickering, or even water refraction. This level of realtime customization is not possible with Unity's baked lighting alone. It utilizes straightforward custom shaders similar to Unity's Standard shader and is compatible with the built-in render pipeline. The minimum Unity Editor requirement is 2021.2.18f1 up to and including Unity 6.

To raytrace the scene, game objects must be marked as static.

#### Cons
The main limitation of this technique is that lights with shadows cannot change their position. If they have to move, they become real-time lights that cast no shadows and can potentially shine through walls, if their radius allows for it. Depending on the use case and level design, this may never be a problem at all.

However, real-time shadows are supported and can be used sparingly to overcome this limitation.
