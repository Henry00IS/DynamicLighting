# Dynamic Lighting for Unity.

This package brings an old school lighting technique to Unity.

It is inspired by Tim Sweeney's lighting system in Unreal Gold and Unreal Tournament (1996-1999).

This lighting technique precomputes unique shadows for each light source, allowing dynamic adjustments such as color changes, flickering, volumetric effects, rotating spot lights, animated cookies, or even water refraction; all after baking the scene has already finished. This level of realtime customization is not possible with Unity's baked lighting alone (mixing the Progressive Lightmapper and this technique is supported). It utilizes straightforward custom shaders similar to Unity's Standard shader and is compatible with the built-in render pipeline (URP is supported with some limitations). The minimum Unity Editor requirement is 2021.2.18f1 up to and including Unity 6.1.

To raytrace the scene, game objects must be marked as static.

#### Cons

The main limitation of this technique is that lights with shadows cannot change their position. If they have to move, they become real-time lights that cast no shadows and can potentially shine through walls, if their radius allows for it. Depending on the use case and level design, this may never be a problem at all.

However, real-time shadows are supported and can be used sparingly to overcome this limitation.

## Installation Instructions:

Add the following line to your Unity Package Manager:

## Quick Start Guide

After installing the package (via the Git URL in the Unity Package Manager), follow these steps to add and bake dynamic lights.

1. **Add Dynamic Lights to Your Scene**  
   From Unity's menu, go to **GameObject > Light** and select from the new options: **Dynamic Point Light**, **Dynamic Spot Light**, or **Dynamic Special Light**.  
   This adds a customizable light source with precomputed shadows, inspired by classic Unreal lighting. Position it and adjust properties like color or intensity in the Inspector.  
   (Mark relevant GameObjects as Static for accurate raytracing-required for shadows.)

   *Select from Dynamic Lighting options under GameObject > Light.*

2. **Enable the Scene Overlay and Preview**  
   In the Scene view toolbar activate the **Dynamic Lighting Overlay** to visualize light coverage and shadows in real-time.

   *Toolbar with Overlay/Preview/Bake buttons; baking panel for raytrace and bounce settings. Tip: Activate the scene overlay first.*

3. **Bake the Lights**  
   With the overlay active, click the **Bake** button in the toolbar or baking window.  
   This precomputes unique shadows per light, enabling post-bake dynamics like flickering, color changes, or volumetric effects.
