# Custom Shaders

You can copy either `DynamicLightingDiffuse.shader` or `DynamicLightingMetallic.shader` into your **Assets** folder and customize them to fit your project's needs.

When doing so, make sure to give the shader a **unique name** inside of the source code, for example:

`Shader "Dynamic Lighting/Superior Diffuse"`

If you build a feature that feels essential or broadly useful, feel free to share it with us on Discord (https://discord.gg/sKEvrBwHtq). GitHub isn't ideal for open-ended discussions or brainstorming, so Discord is the best place for feedback, collaboration, and suggestions that might become official features.

Have fun! ~Henry
